# JS-forms

For this project I followed the tutorial in the guide as starting point and found that very insightful. I then added a phone number field and checkbox.
If left unfilled the input boxes should display an error message, if successfully filled out it should display a success icon and color.
The checkbox should display two different messages depending on if it is checked or not.
